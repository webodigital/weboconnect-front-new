            <h3>STANDARD REFUND TERMS</h3>
            <!--<hr style="height: 2px;background-color: #00458e;">-->
            <p class="fs-16 fw-400">This Policy is provided in the English language. To the extent any translation is provided to you, it is provided for convenience purposes only, and in the event of any conflict between the English and translated version, the English version will control and prevail.</p>
            <p class="fs-16 fw-400">Weboconnect strives for accuracy in billing but recognizes that discrepancies may occur. Therefore, Weboconnect will review a charge at customer request when notified within 90 days of the charge appearing in our financial CRM. If it is determined that the charge was made in error by Weboconnect, a reverse charge will be issued to refund the customer.</p>
            <h3>Refund Policy for Advance (Partial) Payments</h3>
            <p class="fs-16 fw-400">Weboconnect only collects advance payment of 15-20 % of total value for any service that are rendered on https://www.Weboconnect.com after completion of Research and documentation of any services like Portal development, Android app development or iOS App development. After showing the basic design or documentation to customers such advances are non-refundable.</p>
            <h3>Request a Refund</h3>
            <p class="fs-16 fw-400">
            Send email to billing@weboconnect.com and let us know which charge you believe was made in error.
            </p>
            <p class="fs-16 fw-400">
            Include details so that we can locate your charge: department, date the charge appeared on CRM (must be within the last 90 days), budget number, charged amount, description of service billed, and reason for submitting the request.
            </p>

            <p class="fs-16 fw-400"> We will send a reply email to notify you whether your budget is eligible for a refund based on the details you provided.</p>

            <p class="fs-16 fw-400">If your request for a refund is confirmed, the charge will be reversed and will be processed to your budget.</p>
            <p class="fs-16 fw-400">If it is determined that the charge was not the fault of Weboconnect (for example: customer failed to cancel a service), then we will verify the service should be cancelled to stop future billing.
            </p>
